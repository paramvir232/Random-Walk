# Random-Walk
This programs generates Random-Walk. Random walks are not just theoreticalâ€”they model real-world phenomena like stock market prices, the movement of particles in physics, and even animal foraging behavior. This project helped me deepen my understanding of stochastic processes and their applications in data science and beyond.
